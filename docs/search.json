    "text": "First, these are the main libraries I used.\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(metapip)\nlibrary(data.table)\nHowever, make sure to have installed the following packages as well: cli and rlang .\nThe following is the example of the function I need to be ‚Äúhandle‚Äù with tryCatch . This function tries to check if there are duplicates in dt according to some keyVar and if there are duplicates it could abort and exit or continue without exiting. The function has another two parameters to decide the following:\n1. log_err if we want the error to be included in a error-report log ( TRUE and FALSE)\n2. skip_err if we want the error to be skipped ( TRUE and FALSE)\n# Function to handle duplicated observations in pfw\nunq_pfw &lt;- function(dt,\n                    keyVar,\n                    log_err = TRUE,\n                    skip_err = TRUE) {\n\n  tryCatch(\n\n    expr = {\n\n      if(uniqueN(dt, by = keyVar) != nrow(dt)){\n\n        dt_d &lt;- dt[duplicated(dt, by = keyVar)]\n        n_rep &lt;- nrow(dt_d)\n\n        cli::cli_abort(message = \"There {?is/are} {n_rep} duplicates in `pfw`\",\n                       class = c(\"dup_pfw\", \"piperr\"),\n                       log = log_err,\n                       skip = skip_err,\n                       link =  unique(dt_d$link),\n                       call = sys.call())\n      }\n\n    },\n\n    dup_pfw = function(cnd){\n\n      if(cnd$log){ # Log the error\n\n        add_log(cnd)\n\n      }\n\n      if(!cnd$skip){ # Abort if you don't want to skip, but after logging\n\n        cli::cli_abort(cnd$message, call = cnd$call)\n\n      }\n\n    },\n\n    finally = {\n\n      dt &lt;- unique(dt, by = keyVar) # eliminate duplicates\n\n    }\n\n  )\n\n\n  return(dt)\n\n}\nIf you run the lines within expr ={ } , this will probably crash and an error about duplicates will be shown. However, what I want is to first record this error on a log, and then decide if to skip the error or not, and get a clean dataset. That is why we need tryCatch . As you can see within the finally section, I also included a line that eliminates the duplicates and returns the new ‚Äúclean‚Äù dataset. This is because I am going to ‚Äúhandle‚Äù the abort actions with tryCatch and after this, R will ‚Äúfinally‚Äù run these lines and give us the clean output we need (if we do not want to abort).\nNow let me explain the steps within the tryCatch . First, you might be wondering what are the parameters within cli::cli_abort() . I assume message is straightforward. However, class might be the most important. The class we give to this specific error, or condition, will be what makes it identifiable on our tryCatch . Since we gave a new class to the error called dup_pfw , the function tryCatch, instead of aborting and exiting the code when the error is found, will run the code within dup_pfw = function(cnd){ } instead. The parameter cnd then carries all the information we gave within cil::cli_abort ; the class , the log/skip actions, and the identifiers of the duplicates link .\nImportant: The parameters log and skip within cil::cli_abort are my tools to decide how to handle this error and these are totally made up by me for this specific function. You can create any parameter you want within cli::abort() and this will carry on within the handler. For example, I created the parameter link which will carry the identifiers of those duplicated observations. These are needed for the error-report log.\nTalking about the log, before you run the code below, please load the following function add_log . This function will load some concatenated text on the file log.txt saved in your working directory and it is used within the handler.\n# Function for logging\nadd_log &lt;- function(cnd) {\n\n  cat(\n    \"[\", class(cnd)[[1]], \"-\", class(cnd)[[2]], \"] \",\n    cnd$message,\" for \",\n    cnd$link, \"\\n\", sep = \"\",\n    file = \"log.txt\", append = TRUE\n  )\n\n}"
